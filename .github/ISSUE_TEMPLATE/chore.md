### Describe the nature of the chore

<!-- 
We write chores like user stories, similar to feature requests.

For example 
- As a product owner
- I want a chore issue template
- so that it is easier to create issues that can be categorized separately from user-facing enhancements

For more info on chores, see https://scrumdictionary.com/term/chore/

Feel free to add as many "as a, I want, so that" requirements as relevant.
-->

- As a <!-- who -->
- I want <!-- what  -->
- so that <!-- why-->


### Anything else?

<!-- What other context is important to add, but unable to be captured story-style? -->

### Resources

<!-- Add documentation, links, etc. here that provide sources or additional context -->
